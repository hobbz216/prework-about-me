      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I recently received my Master's in Cybersecurity at Utica College. 
        I was introduced to programming there and become hooked.  I joined
        this coding bootcamp to jumpstart my career as a programmer.  I'm happily married and a father
        to three amazing kids.
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm from Bridgeport, PA, outside of Philadelphia</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Gaming, woodworking, basketball and brewing my own beer.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>No specific job, as long as I'm my own boss.  Would like to
        create something that helps others.
      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Currently live in Morton, PA</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>It allows you to be creative while also teaching a versatile and
        in-demand skill.  It's a career where I believe you can tell others
        that you love what you do.
